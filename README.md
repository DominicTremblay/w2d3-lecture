## Question: What is the Internet?

- [Internet Model](./internet-network.png)

- The Internet relies on the TCP/IP protocol

> A protocol is a **standard set of rules** that allow electronic devices to **communicate** üì° with each other. These rules include what type of data may be transmitted, what commands are used to send and receive data, and how data transfers are confirmed.

> You can think of a protocol as a **spoken language**.

## TCP

### An analogy: our mail system

(a) üì® Writing a letter to somebody:

- you put the letter in an enveloppe
- you put the address on it
- send it through the mail
- the recipient receives the letter

(b) üì® ‚úÇÔ∏è Writing a letter to somebody:

- cutting your letter in 5 pieces
- each part is inserted into its own enveloppe with the same address
- send each enveloppe through the mail
- the recipient needs to wait until all the enveloppes are received
- the recipient can put together all the pieces to have the full letter

### TCP üíª üîÅ üíª

- Transmisson Control Protocol
- Messages are broken down into packets and travel over the network to be reassemble

![TCP](./tcp.png)

- Messages are broken down into packets
- Messages contained source and destination address in their header
- Each packet travels through the network independantly
- Packets are reassemble into a full message when reaching destination

### IP

- Internet Protocol
- Address that identifies a computer on the network
- Format xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

`ping lighthouselabs.com`

### TCP Demo ‚ú®

- We'll create a small chat app with the `net` api of node.
- We need a client `(client.js)` and a server `(server.js)`

#### Overview

##### What should our server.js do üóº

- creates a tcp server
- listen for connection
- on receipt of a new connection, sends the connected client a welcome message
  then listen for any data subsequently sent through that connection
- on receipt of any data, broadcast that data to all currently connected clients

##### What should our client.js do üíª

- create a tcp connection to our server
  with port and host
- it set it's encoding i.e. how the it interprets server's messages
- When connected, console.log('your connected')
- Whenever it receives (data) message from server, it should display that message to console
- Whenever we type something to console, it should send what we typed to the server

#### Events in JS

- could be: an input from a user, (lots of events in the browser), stdin data

- Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so you can respond to them as needed.

- The system will give a signal when an event occurs, so that the appropriate response (that is, a callback function) is taken.

- Events are Asynchronous
  - An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.

### Protocols on Top of TCP/IP

Languages that computers program use to communicate with one another (usually over a network)

| Protocol    | Description                                   |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| http        | Browse Web pages                              |
| https       | Browse Web page with encrypted communication  |
| smtp        | Send and receive emails                       |
| imap, pop 3 | Load emails from an inbox                     |
| irc         | Text based chat                               |
| ftp         | File transfers                                |
| ssh         | Secure socket shell with encrypted connection |
| ssl         | low-level secure data transfer used by https  |

- each of these protocols use a default port

| Protocol   | Default port |
| :--------- | :----------- |
| http       | 80           |
| https      | 443          |
| ssh        | 22           |
| postgreslq | 5432         |
| mongodb    | 27017        |

### Client Server Communication

- A client initiates a connection to a server
- Client asks for a resource
- Server sends back a response with the corresponding resource

![Client-Server Communication](./client-server-web.png)

#### Other Type of Communication

- Peer-to-peer: clients establish connections directly to other connections with no central server
- bittorrent

## The Web

- What's happening when I type an address in a browser

### URL

- Uniform Resource Locator
- Anatomy of an URL

![URL](./url.png)

### http Protocol

- hypertext transfer protocol
- how a web browser (client) communications with a web server (server)
- The client initiates a request and the server sends back a response

![Client-Server Web](./client-server-web.png)

[List of http status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)

#### http verbs

- http requests begin with a verb

(CRUD)

üëâ Create
üëâ Read
üëâ Update
üëâ Delete

1Ô∏è‚É£ **`Get`** - get a resource (Read)
2Ô∏è‚É£ **`Post`** - send a resource (Create)
3Ô∏è‚É£ **`Put`** - Update a resource (Update)
4Ô∏è‚É£ **`Delete`** - delete a resource (Delete)

- http requests and response both have a _header_ and a _body_

#### http Headers

- Headers use key value pairs

`key: value`

##### Request Headers
